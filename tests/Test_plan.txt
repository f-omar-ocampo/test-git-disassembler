*	TESTING PLAN FOR DISASSEMBLER					*
*									*
*************************************************************************

In order to ensure the proyect has basic quality we are going to create a test plan.

This test plan will consist in 2 sets of testing:
	* Feature testing
	* Specification testing

Feature testing will test the features of disassemble program, this features 
were previously defined in our SRS

Specification testing will test general specification of disassemble program.

TC = Test Case
DA = Disassemble

Tests will be created in python in order to speed up the process.
Gtest will be used. Two different gtest binaries will be created: features and specs.d

FEATURE TESTING:

TC_DA_OpenBinFile -DONE- Also sent a python file to make disassembler ignore such files.
	Information: Disassemble must be able to open binary or object files, ignore the rest of the files.

TC_DA_Negative_SendNonExistanceFile -DONE-
	Information: Sent to disassemble a file that does not exists, disassemble must show error and exit.

TC_DA_PrintElf -DONE-
	Information: Disassemble must print the ELF headers of a binary file (Default ON)

TC_DA_NoPrintElf -DONE-
	Information: Disassemble must have an option to print ELF headers of a file. Option to not print will be send, ELF headers must not be printed.
TC_DA_GenInst
	Information: Disassemble output should have at least one General Instruction decoded
TC_DA_x86FPUInst
	Information: Disassemble output should have at least one x86FPU Instruction decoded
TC_DA_x86SIMDInst
	Information: Disassemble output should have at least one x86SIMD Instruction decoded
TC_DA_IntelMMxInst
	Information: Disassemble output should have at least one IntelMMx Instruction decoded
TC_DA_SSEInst
	Information: Disassemble output should have at least one SSE Instruction decoded
TC_DA_SSE2Inst
	Information: Disassemble output should have at least one SSE2 Instruction decoded
TC_DA_SSE3Inst
	Information: Disassemble output should have at least one SSE2 Instruction decoded
TC_DA_SSSE3Inst
	Information: Disassemble output should have at least one SSSE3 Instruction decoded
TC_DA_SSE4Inst
	Information: Disassemble output should have at least one SSE4 Instruction decoded
TC_DA_AESNInst
	Information: Disassemble output should have at least one AESN Instruction decoded
TC_DA_IntelAVX
	Information: Disassemble output should have at least one Intel AVX Instruction decoded
TC_DA_FS16CInst
	Information: Disassemble output should have at least one FS16C Instruction decoded
TC_DA_SysInst
	Information: Disassemble output should have at least one Sys Instruction decoded
TC_DA_IA32Inst
	Information: Disassemble output should have at least one IA32 Instruction decoded
TC_DA_VMXINst
	Information: Disassemble output should have at least one VMX Instruction decoded
TC_DA_SMXInst
	Information: Disassemble output should have at least one SMX Instruction decoded

SPECIFICATION TESTING:

TC_DA_BinFileName
	Information: Executable main file must be named disassemble
TC_DA_Less1KbFile
	Information: Use a file smaller than 1Kb to disassemlbe	file must be ignored and exit gracefully
TC_DA_More100MbFile
	Information: Use a file larger than 100Mb to disassemble file must be ignored and exit gracefully
TC_DA_GcovPercent
	Information: Gcov results must provide a result of coverage greater or equal to 80%
